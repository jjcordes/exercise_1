It was somewhat surprising to me that the mortality, readmission, and effective care scores were not strongly correlated with survey scores.  
The mortality score was completely uncorrelated (actually had a slight negative correlation of -0.00832), while effective care (0.04546) and
readmission score (0.127971) were slightly positively correlated.  A possible explanation for this is that the hospitals that provide the best
care are also the most popular and therefore the most crowded.  To the extent that surveys reflect people feeling rushed and/or ignored, those negative
responses could wash out the positive responses related to quality of care.

On the other hand, the effective care scores for the procedures with the highest variability were strongly negatively correlated with survey scores.
The top three measurements, in terms of variability, were Ed 1b, Ed 2b, and OP 18b, which had correlations of -0.37427, -0.34986, and -0.30879, respectively.
So, the correlation was strongest for the procedures with the most variability.
