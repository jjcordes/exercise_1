Some tips on running this code:
  (1) Set up and get EC2 instance running and with an EBS volume mounted as described in Labs 1 through 3.
  (2) Connect to the EC2 instance by using the "ssh -i ..." command from the folder with your .pem file.
  (3) Make sure hadoop and postgres are running ("/root/start-hadoop.sh" and "/data/start_postgres.sh")
  (4) Grab these files (either scp them or clone the github acct)
